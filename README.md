## <a name="project_description"></a>Project Description:
  > - Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation), findings, and key takeaways in a Jupyter Notebook Final Report.
  > - Create modules (acquire.py, prepare.py) that make my process repeateable and easy to follow.
  > - Explore data that will help to understand the drivers of customers churning. Answer questions that arise using charts and statistical tests.
  > - Construct a model to predict customer churn using classification techniques, and make predictions for a group of customers.
  > - Refine work and processes into a Final Report that shows what work was done, my goals, what I found and my conclusions.

## <a name="planning"></a>Project Planning:
  
  
 ### Business Goals: 
 > - Find drivers for customer churn at Telco. Why are customers churning?
 > - Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
 > - Deliver a report that a non-data scientist can read through and understand.

 ### Audience:
> - My target audience is for fellow Codeup Students and staff. 
        
  
### Hypothesis:






### Deliverables:
> - A final report notebook
> - A final report notebook presentation
> - All necessary modules to make my project reproducible


### Nice to haves (With more time):
> - On your best model, a chart visualizing how it performed on test would be valuable.
