## <a name="project_description"></a>Project Description:
  > - Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation), findings, and key takeaways in a Jupyter Notebook Final Report.
  > - Create modules (acquire.py, prepare.py) that make my process repeateable and easy to follow.
  > - Explore data that will help to understand the drivers of customers churning. Answer questions that arise using charts and statistical tests.
  > - Construct a model to predict customer churn using classification techniques, and make predictions for a group of customers.
  > - Refine work and processes into a Final Report that shows what work was done, my goals, what I found and my conclusions.

## <a name="planning"></a>Project Planning:
  
  
 ### Business Goals: 
 > - Find drivers for customer churn at Telco. Why are customers churning?
 > - Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
 > - Deliver a report that a non-data scientist can read through and understand.

 ### Audience:
> - My target audience is for fellow Codeup Students and staff. 
        
  
### Hypothesis:



### Target variable


### Deliverables:
> - A final report notebook

### Stats Test 1: ANOVA Test: One Way

Analysis of variance, or ANOVA, is a statistical method that separates observed variance data into different components to use for additional tests. 

A one-way ANOVA is used for three or more groups of data, to gain information about the relationship between the dependent and independent variables: in this case our clusters vs. the log_error, respectively.

To run the ANOVA test in Python use the following import: \
<span style="color:green">from</span> scipy.stats <span style="color:green">import</span> f_oneway

- f_oneway, in this case, takes in the individual clusters and returns the f-statistic, f, and the p_value, p:
    - the f-statistic is simply a ratio of two variances. 
    - The p_vlaue is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct

#### Hypothesis:
- The null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) is
- The alternate hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>) is 

#### Confidence level and alpha value:
- I established a 95% confidence level
- alpha = 1 - confidence, therefore alpha is 0.05

#### Results:


#### Summary:


### Stats Test 2: T-Test: One Sample, Two Tailed
- A T-test allows me to compare a categorical and a continuous variable by comparing the mean of the continuous variable by subgroups based on the categorical variable
- The t-test returns the t-statistic and the p-value:
    - t-statistic: 
        - Is the ratio of the departure of the estimated value of a parameter from its hypothesized value to its standard error. It is used in hypothesis testing via Student's t-test. 
        - It is used in a t-test to determine if you should support or reject the null hypothesis
        - t-statistic of 0 = H<sub>0</sub>
    -  - the p-value:
        - The probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct
- We wanted to compare the individual clusters to the total population. 
    - Cluster1 to the mean of ALL clusters
    - Cluster2 to the mean of ALL clusters, etc.

#### Hypothesis:
- The null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) is 
- The alternate hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>) is 

#### Confidence level and alpha value:
- I established a 95% confidence level
- alpha = 1 - confidence, therefore alpha is 0.05

#### Model 1: Linear Regression (OLS)


- Model 1 results:



### Model 2 : Lasso Lars Model


- Model 2 results:


### Model 3 : Tweedie Regressor (GLM)

- Model 3 results:


### Model 4: Quadratic Regression Model

- Model 4 results:


## Selecting the Best Model:

### Use Table below as a template for all Modeling results for easy comparison:

| Model | Validation/Out of Sample RMSE | R<sup>2</sup> Value |
| ---- | ----| ---- |
| Baseline | 0.167366 | 2.2204 x 10<sup>-16</sup> |
| Linear Regression (OLS) | 0.166731 | 2.1433 x 10<sup>-3</sup> |  
| Tweedie Regressor (GLM) | 0.155186 | 9.4673 x 10<sup>-4</sup>|  
| Lasso Lars | 0.166731 | 2.2204 x 10<sup>-16</sup> |  
| Quadratic Regression | 0.027786 | 2.4659 x 10<sup>-3</sup> |  


- {} model performed the best
